### Using the Sample

To use the sample app you will need to obtain your API key from the [Botstacks Dashboard](https://dashboard.botstacks.ai/settings). If you donâ€™t yet have one, you can [create one for FREE](https://dashboard.botstacks.ai/)!

Once you have your key update `botstacks_api_key` in [keys.xml](../app/src/androidMain/res/values/keys.xml).

If you want Giphy support and/or Google Maps rendering support you will need API keys for those services as well.
